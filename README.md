# Non-Free Fonts

This [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)/[Caskroom](http://caskroom.io) tap contains
various non-free fonts from around the Internet.

## License and copyright

Note that no font files or archives are kept in this repository. This repository
simply makes it easier to install the font files from well-known locations.

Assume that each font is copyrighted, but permitted to be used provided that you
have installed a certain program or otherwise paid a certain party for its use.

If you use a commercial font in a commercial work and you didn't pay for
the font or otherwise gain permission to use it, the ghost of
[Morris Fuller Benton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Fuller_Benton) will
mess with your kernings now and forevermore.
